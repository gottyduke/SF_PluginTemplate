### üî® Building

```
git clone https://github.com/gottyduke/SF_PluginTemplate.git Plugin

```

### üì¶ Deployment

This plugin template comes with a simple custom deployer script to enable custom distribution rules fitting most use cases.  
To get started on adding custom deploy rules, check out the [default examples](Plugin/dist/rules).  
| action    | usage                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `base`    | set variable `params[0]` with value `params[1]`              |
| `copy`    | copy `params[0]` to `params[1]`                              |
| `copy_if` | do `copy` if file exists                                     |
| `package` | add `params[0..-1]` list of sources to zip file `params[-1]` |
| `remove`  | remove `params` list of sources                              |
| `script`  | execute raw powershell script                                |


The following base variables are provided by default:
```
cmake_output    // this is the binary output path
dist            // this is the dist folder path, also the working directory of deployer script
project_name    // project name same as CMakeLists
project_version // project version same as CMakeLists
```

Deploy actions can be enabled by build configuration(`debug`, `release`, `relwithdebinfo`, etc)
